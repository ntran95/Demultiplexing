'''Problem/Objective: given 4 files: 2 biological reads (R1 & R2), 2 index reads (R2, R3). Look through the biological files, use the index files as reference, and store the reads into their respective category:
(24 known indeces) x 2 (forward and reverse) index-paired = 48 fastq files
2 (forward and reverse) index hopped
2 (forward and reverse) unmatched/low qual
'''

#the two low qual files do not match the index and do not meet the qual score cut off
# my qual score cut off, based on part 1 is: 25, meaning all mean qual with the min 25 is kept (basically I want all my reads)

# I want to read in the two biological files and export the reads that are index-paired, index-hopped, and low quality (containing unknown N's or just low quality)'''

#since I made an arg parse function, I can read in all four files (R1-R4) simulataneously

#maybe make a function that executes the reverse compliment index/barcode and seq1 and seq2
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#create an empty list that holds all known index
#known_index_dict=[]
#when I read in the R1, R2, R3, R4 files, I'm going to compare the strings to the sequence in the list/dict of known indexes

#read in the indexes.txt file
#extract columns 4 and 5: index and index sequences
#store the ouputs into a dictionary
#make the index (i.g B1) the keys, make index sequences the value (i.g GTAGCGTA)
